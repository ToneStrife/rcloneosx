RcloneOSX is compiled with support for macOS version 10.11 - 10.13. The application is implemented in **Swift 4** by using **Xcode 9**. RcloneOSX **require** the `rclone` utility to be installed. If installed in other directory than `/usr/local/bin`, please change directory by user Configuration in RcloneOSX. RcloneOSX checks if there is a `rclone` installed in the provided directory.

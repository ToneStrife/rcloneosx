## RcloneOSX

![](icon/rcloneosx.png)

The project is a adapting [RsyncOSX](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncOSX) utilizing [rclone](https://rclone.org/) for synchronizing and backup of catalogs and files to a number of cloud services. RcloneOSX utilizes `rclone copy`, `sync`, `move` and `check` commands.

Rclone is *rsync for cloud storage*. Even if they are somewhat equal they are also different in many ways. RcloneOSX is built upon the ideas from RsyncOSX. But it is not possible to clone all functions in RsyncOSX to RcloneOSX. I spend most of my time developing RsyncOSX and from time to time some of the functions within RcloneOSX are ported from RsyncOSX. I am quite sure I could do more development in RcloneOSX, but my main focus is RsyncOSX. I am not an advanced user of rclone. I am synchronizing my GitHub catalog to Dropbox and Google.

I have also implemented [encrypted](/Encrypted) backup in RsyncOSX by utilizing RcloneOSX.

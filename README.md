## RcloneOSX

The project is a port of RsyncOSX to adapt [rclone](https://rclone.org/). It compiles, it executes and it does a `rclone copy` command but there is still much work to do. See [Changelog](Documentation/docs/RcloneOSX/Changelog.md).

RcloneOSX will be compiled with support for macOS version 10.11 - 10.13. The application is implemented in **Swift 4** by using **Xcode 9**.

#### SwiftLint

As part of this version of RsyncOSX I am using [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) as tool for writing more readable code.

### Application icon

The application icon is created by [Forrest Walter](http://www.forrestwalter.com/). All rights reserved to Forrest Walter.
